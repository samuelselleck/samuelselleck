### Hi there, lovely to meet you! <3

I'm a curious engineer from Sweden who loves science 🧬💥

I like fractals ❄️🐚 and other things that look complex but boil down to simple rules (like us 🌍🌌). I enjoy trying new things 🏄‍♂️ and being bad at things. I don't particularly enjoy feeling mediocre at things. I do enjoy feeling good at things.

I watch a lot of Youtube 📚. Some favorite channels are: [Applied Science](https://www.youtube.com/@AppliedScience), [Jon Gjengset](https://www.youtube.com/@jonhoo), [Technology Connections](https://www.youtube.com/@TechnologyConnections), [Primitive Technology](https://www.youtube.com/@primitivetechnology9550), [Simone Giertz](https://www.youtube.com/@simonegiertz) and [Kurzgesagt](https://www.youtube.com/@kurzgesagt). (If you'd like more recommendations, don't hesitate to ask).

My favorite language is [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), but don't worry, I'm not going to go off about it for too long. I'm really interested in [AI Safety](https://aisafety.info/).

Recently migrated to the California Bay Area 🏞️.

### Technical things I am proud of

Semi-successfully removed a [spatially variant image blurring effect](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YxanN78k-4-meaG0Hsz92i-d0j8HfYl1H4cdfQf7ZUo/edit?usp=sharing) during my time at [MAX IV Laboratory](https://www.maxiv.lu.se/). Built a bunch of [educational optics apps](https://openopticsmodule.com/) from scratch that help students learn about geometrical optics. Won a high performance [programming challenge](https://github.com/KvGeijer/SamKo-HPDSO22-Stockholm-Challenge) with partner [Kåre von Geijer](https://karevongeijer.com/) at [HPDSO](https://www.hyperightdataclub.com/hp-data-science-open-stockholm/). And other things!

### I would like to spend more time
Remembering to be grateful and enjoy the small things **|** Learning from people who know a lot **|** Spending more time outdoors **|** Understanding myself better **|** Writing [blogs](https://samuelselleck.com)

I'm friendly, say hi!
